<h1 align="center" style="font-weight: bold;">ðŸ¤– AIAgents4Pharma</h1>

Welcome to **AIAgents4Pharma** â€“ an open-source project by [Team VPE](https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine) that brings together AI-driven tools to help researchers and pharma interact seamlessly with complex biological data.

Our toolkit currently consists of three agents, each designed to simplify and enhance access to complex data in biology:

- [**Talk2BioModels**](talk2biomodels/models/intro.md): Engage directly with mathematical models in systems biology.

- [**Talk2Cells**](talk2cells/intro.md) _(Work in progress)_: Query and analyze sequencing data with ease.

- [**Talk2KnowledgeGraphs**](talk2knowledgegraphs/intro.md) _(Coming soon)_: Access and explore complex biological knowledge graphs for insightful data connections.

- [**Talk2Competitors**](talk2competitors/intro.md) _(Work in progress)_: Access and explore papers and receive recommendations for academic papers using natural language processing.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **Git**
- Required libraries specified in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

#### Option 1: PyPI

```bash
pip install aiagents4pharma
```

Check out the tutorials on each agent for detailed instrcutions.

#### Option 2: Git

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VirtualPatientEngine/AIAgents4Pharma
   cd AIAgents4Pharma
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize OPENAI_API_KEY**

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=....
   ```

4. **[Optional] Set up login credentials**

   ```bash
   vi .streamlit/secrets.toml
   ```

   and enter

   ```
   password='XXX'
   ```

   Please note that the passowrd will be same for all.

5. **[Optional] Initialize LANGSMITH_API_KEY**

   ```bash
   export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true
   export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
   ```

   Please note that this will create a new tracing project in your Langsmith
   account with the name `<user_name>@<uuid>`, where `user_name` is the name
   you provided in the previous step. If you skip the previous step, it will
   default to `default` (a 128 bit unique ID created for the session).

6. **Launch the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/frontend/streamlit_app.py
   ```
